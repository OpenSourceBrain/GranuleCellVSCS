This is the directory for the cell morphology files associated with the project.
The following types of files are found here: 

   *.java.xml: morphologies (ucl.physiol.neuroconstruct.cell.Cell class) saved in Java XML serialized form (note: not part of NeuroML).
   *.java.ser: morphologies saved in Java binary serialized object form (smaller files & quicker to load)

   *.bak files backup the previously stored morphology before a new one is saved.

Note that the cells aren't currently stored here in NeuroML format, as functionality can be added to the neuroConstruct Cell class before it is supported in the standards.
